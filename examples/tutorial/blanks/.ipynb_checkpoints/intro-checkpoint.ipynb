    "## The `Matvec` abstraction for solving PDEs with FEM\n",
    "\n",
    "Continuous Galerkin, discontinuous Galerkin, and SEM are some of the many flavors of FEM. Many of these implementations utilize similar \"boilerplate\" mathematical operations to setup and solve PDEs. The \"boilerplate\" operations that immediately come to mind:\n",
    "1. Gather-scatter\n",
    "2. Interpolation to/projection from a quadrature domain\n",
    "\n",
    "To describe this mathematically, suppose we have the following ingredients:\n",
    "1. An operator $A$. Typically the entries of $A$ are inner products of basis functions, like $A_{ij}$ = $\\int_{\\Omega} \\phi_i \\phi_j d\\Omega$, possibly with derivatives on either or both basis functions.\n",
    "2. Global degrees-of-freedom (DOFs) $u$\n",
    "3. An operator $E$ such that element-local DOFs are given by $u_{\\ell} = Eu$ and $u = E^T u_{\\ell}$ gets us back to global DOFs\n",
    "\n",
    "We can apply the *global* operator $A^G$ as\n",
    "$$\n",
    "A^G u = E^T A E u.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This operation is similar to another, somewhat more complicated operation, where we first interpolate our global DOFs to a quadrature domain before applying the operator $A$. After we apply $A$, we project our result back. Specifically, given a set of basis functions $\\{\\phi_i\\}_{i=0}^N$, where $N$ is our desired polynomial order, and a set of quadrature nodes $\\{\\xi_k\\}_{k=0}^{N_q}$ we first construct a Vandermonde matrix $V_{ij} = \\phi_j(\\xi_i)$. Then, we perform the following operation:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "A^G u = E^T V^T A V E u.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Regardless of the FEM implementation, we are likely going to be required to perform gather-scatter, interpolation/projection, or both.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial will cover how to use a package called `discr-tools` to setup and solve Poisson's equation."
